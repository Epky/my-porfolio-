# Profile Image Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Picture

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Use a high-quality photo (at least 400x400 pixels)
   - Make sure it's a clear, professional headshot
   - Square format works best (1:1 aspect ratio)
   - Good lighting and clear background

2. **Save your photo:**
   - Rename your photo to `profile.jpg`
   - Place it in this folder: `public/images/profile.jpg`
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

3. **Alternative formats:**
   - If your photo is PNG: rename to `profile.png` and update the src in Hero.js
   - If your photo is WebP: rename to `profile.webp` and update the src in Hero.js

## Current Setup
- The portfolio is looking for: `/images/profile.jpg`
- If no image is found, it will show a code icon placeholder
- The image will be automatically cropped to a circle
- Hover effect will slightly zoom the image

## Tips for Best Results
- Use a professional headshot
- Ensure good lighting
- Plain or blurred background works best
- Smile naturally
- Dress professionally

## File Location
Your profile image should be placed at:
```
public/images/profile.jpg
```

The portfolio will automatically detect and display your photo!
